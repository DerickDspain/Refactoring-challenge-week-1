# Refactoring Challenge week 1



## What is this challenge and its requirements?
The main criteria for this challenge was for us as a student to defactor the HTML and CSS portions of this site, by identifying all div tags used replacing them with the proper Semantic HTML elements. In doing it was also required of us to change the corresponding CSS tags to correlate with what we changed with the HTML.

## What steps were taken and in what order?
* All div tags were located and identified so I was aware of what content was contained within.
* All CSS tags which in direct correlation with said div tags were located.
* Next all div tags were examined and thought over so that the proper semantics were used.
* All CSS in direct correlation with the changed HTML were changed to mimic what was replaced in the HTML.
* "alt" tags were placed in all images for better user accessibility.
* Comments were placed before each change decribing what change was made and why.

## What other changes were made?
Only one other change was made and that was an addition of an "id" within a section to allow the link to work properly. (Ref. Line 34)
